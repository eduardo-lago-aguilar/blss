    <p>BLSS stands for Bootstrapped Linux-Server Systems, it&apos;s a collection of command line tools to quickly assemble, without user interaction, multiple small and optimized Linux-Server Systems with the purpose of an easy deployment of distributed systems, like Apache Hadoop Cloudera Distribution, where every Linux-Server may have a different role in the computational cluster or grid.</p>
    <p>With BLSS you can finally verify -<i>with just one Enter key pressing</i>- if your package-based system really works when you distribute it, and pay any technical debt you posses with yourself not accomplished yet because you donâ€™t have the necessary time for install 10 or 100 servers coordinating jobs in a network.</p>
    <p>Systems you manage with BLSS scripts fit better for servicing purpose, they are reduced in size and have a small memory footprint.  The  lifecycle of such systems is composed of three phases, each one with a corresponding script: prototyping with  <cmdname>lxp</cmdname>, cloning with  <cmdname>lxc</cmdname> and deployment with <cmdname>lxd</cmdname>.   </p>
