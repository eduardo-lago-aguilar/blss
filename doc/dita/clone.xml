    <p>A Linux-system clone, or simply a <term>clone</term>, is a unique copy of a proto also with the root directory as a well known path in the same (or other) <term>host</term> Linux system. In such <term>host</term> is where the <cmdname>lxc</cmdname> (LinuX Clone) command is executed for a clone creation and further customization for uniqueness.
Cloning is a permission-preserving copying of the <term>proto</term> also without any kind of user interaction. The uniqueness is accomplished once the copy is made, by assigning unique IP address, hostname, among other settings and by installing particular packages for this copy only.
This means that a <term>proto</term> acts like an archetype that can be cloned several times, and later each <term>clone</term> is customized for different roles depending on the packages installed. Every <term>clone</term> should have an unique identity, the identity depends mainly of the IP address.
