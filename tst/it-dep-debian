# BLSS stands for Bootstrapped Linux Server Systems, it is set of tools to quickly 
# assemble multiple small & optimized Linux-based virtual appliances with the 
# purpose of an easy deployment of package-based distributed systems, like Apache 
# Hadoop Cloudera Distribution, where every server have a different role in a 
# computational cluster or grid. 
# 
# The delivered virtual appliances fit better for servicing purpose, they are 
# reduced in size and have a small memory footprint. The lifecycle of such systems 
# is composed of three phases: prototyping, where shared packages & configuration 
# is settled; cloning, where different server roles are defined; and finally 
# deployment where unique appliances are produced.
