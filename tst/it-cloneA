# WELCOME TO BLSS
#
# BLSS stands for Bootstrapped Linux-Server Systems, it's a collection of command line tools to
# quickly assemble, without user interaction, multiple small and optimized Linux-Server Systems
# with the purpose of an easy deployment of distributed systems, like Apache Hadoop Cloudera
# Distribution, where every Linux-Server may have a different role in the computational cluster or
# grid.
# With BLSS you can finally verify -with just one Enter key pressing- if your package-based
# system really works when you distribute it, and pay any technical debt you posses with
# yourself not accomplished yet because you donâ€™t have the necessary time for install 10 or 100
# servers coordinating jobs in a network.
# Systems you manage with BLSS scripts fit better for servicing purpose, they are reduced
# in size and have a small memory footprint. The lifecycle of such systems is composed of
# three phases, each one with a corresponding script: prototyping with lxp, cloning with lxc and
# deployment with lxd.

# Integration Test Suite for clone A.  
#
# Multiple calls to lxc can be very time consuming. Therefor several integration 
# tests are executed for a single clone. An integration test, for any clone, 
# assumes that the clone is located at '/tmp/cloneitroot', so every verification is 
# performed on the filesystem hierarchy directly under '/tmp/cloneitroot'.
# 
# Clone settings for Integration Tests are enviroments located under the 'env' 
# directory. The enviroment corresponding to the "cloneA", for example, should 
# have the path $BLSS_HOME/env/A.
# 
# In the scope of Integration Tests, clones are named as 'clone' + one alphabet 
# letters from A..Z in uppercase. 

# Resolve script location, $0 may be a link
script="$0"
# Need this for relative symlinks
