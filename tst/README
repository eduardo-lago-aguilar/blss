BLSS stands for Bootstrapped Linux Server Systems, it is set of tools to quickly 
assemble multiple small & optimized Linux-based virtual appliances with the 
purpose of an easy deployment of package-based distributed systems, like Apache 
Hadoop Cloudera Distribution, where every server have a different role in a 
computational cluster or grid. 

The delivered virtual appliances fit better for servicing purpose, they are 
reduced in size and have a small memory footprint. The lifecycle of such systems 
is composed of three phases: prototyping, where shared packages & configuration 
is settled; cloning, where different server roles are defined; and finally 
deployment where unique appliances are produced.

The project is hosted at https://bitbucket.org/eduardo_lago_aguilar/blss

=== INTEGRATION TESTS FOR PROTOTYPES ===

Multiple calls to lxp are very time consuming, so several integration tests 
are executed for a single prototype. ITs assume that the prototype is located at 
'/tmp/protoitroot', therefor every verification is performed directly under this
path. The settings for the prototype under test is always an environment located
at the 'env' directory. Example, the environment corresponding to the prototype 
creation script 'tst/squeeze/proto' is 'env/squeeze'.

=== INTEGRATION TESTS FOR CLONES ===

Multiple calls to lxc are very time consuming, so several integration tests 
are executed for a single clone. ITs assume that the clone is located at 
'/tmp/cloneitroot', therefor every verification is performed directly under this
path. The settings for the clone under test is always an environment located at 
the 'env' directory. Example, the environment corresponding to the clone creation
script 'tst/squeeze/clone' is 'env/squeeze'.

=== INTEGRATION TESTS FOR DEPLOYMENTS ===

Multiple calls to lxd are very time consuming, so several integration tests 
are executed for a single deployment. ITs assume that the deployment is located 
at '/tmp/deproot/disk.img', therefor every verification is performed directly on 
this archive. The settings for the deployment under test is always an 
environment located at the 'env' directory. Example, the environment 
corresponding to the deployment creation script 'tst/squeeze/dep' is 
'env/squeeze'.
