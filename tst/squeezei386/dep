# WELCOME TO BLSS
#
# BLSS stands for Bootstrapped Linux-Server Systems, it's a collection of command line tools to
# quickly assemble, without user interaction, multiple small and optimized Linux-Server Systems
# with the purpose of an easy deployment of distributed systems, like Apache Hadoop Cloudera
# Distribution, where every Linux-Server may have a different role in the computational cluster or
# grid.
# With BLSS you can finally verify -with just one Enter key pressing- if your package-based
# system really works when you distribute it, and pay any technical debt you posses with
# yourself not accomplished yet because you donâ€™t have the necessary time for install 10 or 100
# servers coordinating jobs in a network.
# Systems you manage with BLSS scripts fit better for servicing purpose, they are reduced
# in size and have a small memory footprint. The lifecycle of such systems is composed of
# three phases, each one with a corresponding script: prototyping with lxp, cloning with lxc and
# deployment with lxd.
