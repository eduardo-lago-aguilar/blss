# WELCOME TO BLSS
#
# BLSS stands for Bootstrapped Linux-Server Systems, it's a collection of command line tools to
# quickly assemble, without user interaction, multiple small and optimized Linux-Server Systems
# with the purpose of an easy deployment of distributed systems, like Apache Hadoop Cloudera
# Distribution, where every Linux-Server may have a different role in the computational cluster or
# grid.
# With BLSS you can finally verify -with just one Enter key pressing- if your package-based
# system really works when you distribute it, and pay any technical debt you posses with
# yourself not accomplished yet because you donâ€™t have the necessary time for install 10 or 100
# servers coordinating jobs in a network.
# Systems you manage with BLSS scripts fit better for servicing purpose, they are reduced
# in size and have a small memory footprint. The lifecycle of such systems is composed of
# three phases, each one with a corresponding script: prototyping with lxp, cloning with lxc and
# deployment with lxd.

# Integration Test Suite for Lenny suite.  
#
# Multiple calls to lxp can be very time consuming. Therefor several integration 
# tests are executed for a single proto. An integration test, for any proto, 
# assumes that the proto is located at '/tmp/protoitroot', so every verification is 
# performed on the filesystem hierarchy directly under '/tmp/protoitroot'.
# 
# Proto settings for Integration Tests are enviroments located under the 'env' 
# directory. The enviroment corresponding to the "protoA", for example, should 
# have the path $BLSS_HOME/env/A.
# 
# In the scope of Integration Tests, protos are named as 'proto' + one alphabet 
# letters from A..Z in uppercase or the name like Squeeze. 

# Test Case: Test for readahead
